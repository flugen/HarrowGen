# Harrow Deck Character Generator.

## Intro
This a relatively simple program designed to implement the character attribute 
generation method written up by Gulthor, found at on the Paizo forums at [
The Harrow Character Generation: Attribute Generation Through Fortune-Telling]
(https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2u1rj?The-Harrow-Character-Generation-Attribute).

The actual rules are found in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CaRq2iGxVH9qD157K47YqWrz5hce_NfdXYWNBEjgM7E/edit)

I've implemented the basic rules including the different point-buy methods, with 
the Lakeside Fantasy variation in progress.

## Images
HarrowGen is designed to display images of the specific Harrow cards during the
course of program. As I am not an artist, I use the Paizo ones. However, I do not
have the rights to them, and so cannot include them in this repository. Feel free
to use whatever card images you want, they only need to be either .jpg or .png and
placed in the /images folder. An example of the naming format is "The Winged Serpent.jpg"
(without quotes, of course).
